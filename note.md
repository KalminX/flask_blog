# Minimal flask application

from flask import Flask

app = Flask(__name__)

# @app.route("/")
# def hello_world():
#     return "<p>Hello, World!</p>"

# flask --app hello run

#Make it publicly available
#flask run --host=0.0.0.0

#flask --app hello run --debug

# from markupsafe import escape

# @app.route("/<name>")
# def hello(name):
#     return f"Hello, {escape(name)}!"

# @app.route('/')
# def index():
#     return 'Index Page'

# @app.route('/hello')
# def hello():
#     return 'Hello, World'

# Variable Rules¶

# from markupsafe import escape

# @app.route('/user/<username>')
# def show_user_profile(username):
#     # show the user profile for that user
#     return f'User {escape(username)}'

# @app.route('/post/<int:post_id>')
# def show_post(post_id):
#     # show the post with the given id, the id is an integer
#     return f'Post {post_id}'

# @app.route('/path/<path:subpath>')
# def show_subpath(subpath):
#     # show the subpath after /path/
#     return f'Subpath {escape(subpath)}'

# URL Building¶
# To build a URL to a specific function, use the url_for() function. It accepts the name of the function as its first argument and any number of keyword arguments, each corresponding to a variable part of the URL rule. Unknown variable parts are appended to the URL as query parameters.

# Why would you want to build URLs using the URL reversing function url_for() instead of hard-coding them into your templates?

# Reversing is often more descriptive than hard-coding the URLs.

# You can change your URLs in one go instead of needing to remember to manually change hard-coded URLs.

# URL building handles escaping of special characters transparently.

# The generated paths are always absolute, avoiding unexpected behavior of relative paths in browsers.

# If your application is placed outside the URL root, for example, in /myapplication instead of /, url_for() properly handles that for you.

# from flask import url_for

# @app.route('/')
# def index():
#     return 'index'

# @app.route('/login')
# def login():
#     return 'login'

# @app.route('/user/<username>')
# def profile(username):
#     return f'{username}\'s profile'

# with app.test_request_context():
#     print(url_for('index'))
#     print(url_for('login'))
#     print(url_for('login', next='/'))
#     print(url_for('profile', username='John Doe'))


# HTTP Methods¶
# Web applications use different HTTP methods when accessing URLs. You should familiarize yourself with the HTTP methods as you work with Flask. By default, a route only answers to GET requests. You can use the methods argument of the route() decorator to handle different HTTP methods.

# from flask import request

# @app.route('/login', methods=['GET', 'POST'])
# def login():
#     if request.method == 'POST':
#         return do_the_login()
#     else:
#         return show_the_login_form()
# The example above keeps all methods for the route within one function, which can be useful if each part uses some common data.

# You can also separate views for different methods into different functions. Flask provides a shortcut for decorating such routes with get(), post(), etc. for each common HTTP method.

# @app.get('/login')
# def login_get():
#     return show_the_login_form()

# @app.post('/login')
# def login_post():
#     return do_the_login()

# Static Files
# Dynamic web applications also need static files. That’s usually where the CSS and JavaScript files are coming from. Ideally your web server is configured to serve them for you, but during development Flask can do that as well. Just create a folder called static in your package or next to your module and it will be available at /static on the application.

# To generate URLs for static files, use the special 'static' endpoint name:

# url_for('static', filename='style.css')
# The file has to be stored on the filesystem as static/style.css.

# Rendering Templates
# Generating HTML from within Python is not fun, and actually pretty cumbersome because you have to do the HTML escaping on your own to keep the application secure. Because of that Flask configures the Jinja2 template engine for you automatically.

# Templates can be used to generate any type of text file. For web applications, you’ll primarily be generating HTML pages, but you can also generate markdown, plain text for emails, and anything else.

# For a reference to HTML, CSS, and other web APIs, use the MDN Web Docs.

# To render a template you can use the render_template() method. All you have to do is provide the name of the template and the variables you want to pass to the template engine as keyword arguments. Here’s a simple example of how to render a template:

# from flask import render_template

# @app.route('/hello/')
# @app.route('/hello/<name>')
# def hello(name=None):
#     return render_template('hello.html', person=name)


# Case 1: a module:

# /application.py
# /templates
#     /hello.html
# Case 2: a package:

# /application
#     /__init__.py
#     /templates
#         /hello.html


# <!doctype html>
# <title>Hello from Flask</title>
# {% if person %}
#   <h1>Hello {{ person }}!</h1>
# {% else %}
#   <h1>Hello, World!</h1>
# {% endif %}

# from markupsafe import Markup
# Markup('<strong>Hello %s!</strong>') % '<blink>hacker</blink>'
# Markup('<strong>Hello &lt;blink&gt;hacker&lt;/blink&gt;!</strong>')
# Markup.escape('<blink>hacker</blink>')
# Markup('&lt;blink&gt;hacker&lt;/blink&gt;')
# Markup('<em>Marked up</em> &raquo; HTML').striptags()
# 'Marked up » HTML'

Redirects and Errors
To redirect a user to another endpoint, use the redirect() function; to abort a request early with an error code, use the abort() function:

from flask import abort, redirect, url_for

@app.route('/')
def index():
return redirect(url_for('login'))

@app.route('/login')
def login():
abort(401)
this_is_never_executed()
This is a rather pointless example because a user will be redirected from the index to a page they cannot access (401 means access denied) but it shows how that works.

By default a black and white error page is shown for each error code. If you want to customize the error page, you can use the errorhandler() decorator:
